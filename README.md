# Advent of Code 2019 starter for JS/TS

## Intro

Forked from [aoc-starter-ts](https://github.com/caderek/aoc-starter-ts) for nice ts templates.

This repo contains zero-setup environment for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges, with:

- automatic creation of a challenge template,
- automatic execution of a challenge code (with reloads),
- quick utils for testing and reading input from a file.

Using NPM:

```shell
npm i
```

## Add a template for a day

```shell
npm start day<N>
```

Example:

```shell
npm start day1
```

If the day folder does not exist, it will be created from template.
